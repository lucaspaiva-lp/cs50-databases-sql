# Reflection on *{{project or dataset}}*

This assignment focused on working with the *{{project or dataset}}* as a whole. Rather than treating each task independently, the main goal was to understand the overall logic and requirements behind the problems.

The primary challenge was  **interpreting the instructions**. Certain terms required careful reading to distinguish between what data should be selected and how the results should be ordered or filtered. Once this distinction was clear, implementing the solution became more straightforward.

To improve accuracy, I began breaking each prompt into **keywords** and logical steps before writing any code. I also used brief **pseudocode** to outline the intended logic, which helped me focus directly on the core problem and avoid unnecessary complexity.

Another important aspect was understanding the **meaning of the data** itself. The values used in the queries represent numerical properties and should be interpreted objectively, without qualitative assumptions.

Overall, this assignment reinforced the importance of careful reading, structured reasoning, and translating natural language requirements into precise logic.
