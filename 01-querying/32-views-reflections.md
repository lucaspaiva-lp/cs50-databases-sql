## Reflection on *32 Views*

This assignment required working with the *32 Views* dataset as a whole, rather than treating each SQL file in isolation. For this reason, my approach and reflection focus on the overall process, patterns, and challenges encountered throughout the problem set.

My main difficulty was  **interpretation**. Similar to my experience with  *Cyberchase*, the challenge was not technical SQL syntax, but understanding the  **precise meaning of certain words within a specific context**. Terms such as  *“highest”*,  *“least”*,  *“most”*, and *“from least to highest”* initially caused confusion, especially when the wording combined both selection criteria and ordering instructions. Once I learned to separate *what should be selected* from  *how the results should be ordered*, the tasks became much clearer.

To address this, I optimized my reading strategy. Instead of reading the prompt linearly, I began breaking each question into **keywords** and logical blocks. I identified the core elements first (what column, which artist, which metric), then focused on qualifiers such as ordering and limits. This significantly reduced misinterpretation and helped me focus only on the relevant details.

Another important step was writing  **pseudocode before coding**. By translating each question into a short logical description—filter, sort, limit—I was able to go directly to the core of the problem without unnecessary trial and error. This made my SQL queries more deliberate and reduced mistakes.

I also noticed minor friction related to  **Japanese names**, particularly artist names. Although no direct consultation of Japanese scripts was required, distinguishing between similar names and maintaining consistency sometimes required extra attention.

Regarding the text 武蔵本牧のはな, this contains **kanji (武蔵本牧)** and  **hiragana (のはな)**, so it is not purely hiragana. While this did not directly affect the assignment, being aware of such distinctions helped avoid incorrect assumptions.

Overall, this problem set reinforced the importance of  **careful reading, precise interpretation, and structured reasoning**. The SQL itself was relatively straightforward; the real challenge was translating natural language instructions into accurate and minimal queries.
