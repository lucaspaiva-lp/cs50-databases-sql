## Repository Organization

Each week or conceptual block is organized into directories following the
progression above. SQL files contain only the queries required by each problem
set, following CS50’s constraints.

## Note on Databases (.db files)

The database files (`<span>.db</span>`) used in the exercises are **not included** in this
repository.

These databases are provided by **CS50 / HarvardX** as part of the official
course materials and are excluded here for  **ethical and academic integrity
reasons** .

All SQL queries in this repository were written and tested against the official
course databases within the authorized learning environment.
